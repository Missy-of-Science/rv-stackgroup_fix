    <p>
    This package moves the left bounding box edge 0.01% of every source in the composite stack inwards,
    so that the artist doesn't have to. This ensures the replace composite stack shows the proper Pixel Aspect Ratio.
    Despite the chosen Composite Tool (Over, Difference, Replace etc.) this package works for every stack, since other
    Tools have shown (less visible) errors.
